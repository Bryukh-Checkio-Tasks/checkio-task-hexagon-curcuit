    <p>Satisfied with his experiment, Nikola sets down <a href="/mission/task/info/destination-in-spiral/">the strange
        circuit</a> and finds an even stranger circuit beside it on the shelf. This one appears to be made of a
        collection of hexagons. Nikola decides to run the same experiment as before with this circuit as well.</p>
</div>

<p>The map of the circuit consists of a collection of hexagonal elements. The first element in the center is
    marked as 1 and in a continuing clockwise spiral, the rest of the elements are marked in ascending order
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum" title="to infinity">ad infinitum</a>. On the map, you can move
    (connect) through the adjoining edges of the hexagonal elements. </p>

<p>For example: the distance between elements 6 and 19 is two moves and the distance between 2 and 9 is one move. You
    must help Nikola find the distance between any two elements on the map.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>  The pair of numbers that represent the 2 elements.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The distance between the 2 elements (integer).

    <pre class="brush: python">checkio([2, 9]) == 1
checkio([9, 2]) == 1
checkio([6, 19]) == 2

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    In some games hexagons are used for map. This task will learn you how to work with this.
