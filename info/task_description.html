    Bees are very organized insects. Let's suppose that bees have numerical order for honeycombs.
    Each cell in the honeycomb is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">hexagon</a>.
    And if they want to build accurate honeycomb then one of the way is build it by spiral.
    And the numerical order will be by this spiral. That way each cell has own number and
    we have navigation system on the honeycomb. Now we should learn how to define distance.
</p>
<p>
    The map of the honeycomb consists of a collection of hexagonal elements.
    The first element in the center is marked as 1 and in a continuing clockwise spiral,
    the rest of the elements are marked in ascending order
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum" title="to infinity">ad infinitum</a>.
    On the map of the circuit, you can "move" (connect) through the adjoining edges of the hexagonal
    elements.

</p>

<p>
    For example: the distance between elements 1 and 9 is two moves and the distance between 8 and
    18 is two move.
    Between 17 and 13 - 4 moves.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Pair of numbers that represent 2 elements as integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The distance between the 2 elements as an integer.

    </p>
    <textarea data-code="python">checkio([2, 9]) == 1
hex_spiral(9, 2) == 1
hex_spiral(6, 19) == 2
hex_spiral(5, 11) == 3</textarea>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    In some games hexagons are used for map. This task will learn you how to work with this.
